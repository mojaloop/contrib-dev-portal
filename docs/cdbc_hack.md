# Mojaloop + Global Fintech Hackcelerator 2021

This Sandbox Environment is here and ready to help you build your Proof-of-Concept for the Global Fintech Hackcelerator 2021



## Getting Started with your POC 

1. Fill in [this Google form]() to request your own 3PPI resources in the sandbox. We aim to do this within 24 hours - but feel free to ping us on our Mojaloop Slack at `#cdbc-hack` if you think it's taking too long!
2. While you're waiting for your resources to be provisioned, read through the [G2P Use Case Guide](todo) that will introduce you to 3PPI on Mojaloop
3.  Play around with the [3ppi Payments API](/apis/sync-3ppi) and the [3PPI Payments Guide](/guides/payments/3ppi-p2p) to see how you will be able to interact with the API


## Then:
1. Register a phone number with our account simulator for you to register a 3PPI Link
2. Set up beneficaries with our bank simulators. These will be accounts that you test sending payments to.
3. Follow the [G2P Account Linking Guide](todo) to link an account you will be sending funds from with your fintech.
4. Build out your solution with the [3ppi Payments API](/apis/sync-3ppi) using your account link you set up
